-- | 5           | Carol      | Davis     | 2             | 65000  |

-- Table: departments
-- | department_id | department_name  |
-- |---------------|------------------|
-- | 1             | Sales            |
-- | 2             | HR               |
-- | 3             | IT               |


-- 1. SELECT Statements

-- Retrieve all data from the employees table
SELECT * FROM employees;

-- Retrieve specific columns from the employees table
SELECT first_name, last_name FROM employees;


-- 2. FILTER (Using WHERE Clause)

-- Filter employees with a salary greater than 60000
SELECT * FROM employees
WHERE salary > 60000;

-- Filter employees in the HR department (department_id = 2)
SELECT * FROM employees
WHERE department_id = 2;


-- 3. ORDER BY Clause

-- Sort employees by salary in ascending order
SELECT * FROM employees
ORDER BY salary;

-- Sort employees by salary in descending order
SELECT * FROM employees
ORDER BY salary DESC;

-- Sort employees by last_name in ascending order and then by first_name
SELECT * FROM employees
ORDER BY last_name, first_name;


-- 4. GROUP BY Clause

-- Find the total salary for each department
SELECT department_id, SUM(salary) AS total_salary
FROM employees
GROUP BY department_id;

-- Find the number of employees in each department
SELECT department_id, COUNT(*) AS number_of_employees
FROM employees
GROUP BY department_id;


-- 5. JOIN Clause

-- Join the employees table with the departments table and get the department name for each employee
SELECT e.first_name, e.last_name, d.department_name
FROM employees e
JOIN departments d ON e.department_id = d.department_id;

-- List all employees and their departments, even if some departments have no employees
SELECT e.first_name, e.last_name, d.department_name
FROM employees e
RIGHT JOIN departments d ON e.department_id = d.department_id;


-- 6. Combining Multiple Clauses

-- Find the average salary per department and list them in descending order of the average salary
SELECT d.department_name, AVG(e.salary) AS average_salary
FROM employees e
JOIN departments d ON e.department_id = d.department_id
GROUP BY d.department_name
ORDER BY average_salary DESC;


-- Additional Queries for Practice

-- Find employees with a salary between 50,000 and 70,000
SELECT * FROM employees
WHERE salary BETWEEN 50000 AND 70000;

-- Find the department with the highest total salary
SELECT department_id, SUM(salary) AS total_salary
FROM employees
GROUP BY department_id
ORDER BY total_salary DESC
LIMIT 1;
